# Quick Start

Let's get a simple Vue TermUI app running on your machine so you can start building your cool new terminal app ðŸ˜Ž

:::tip Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with the command line
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 (Recommended v14)

:::

You can start a project by using the starter. It is configured to use TypeScript by default.

With npm:

```sh
npm create vue-termui@latest
```

With yarn:

```sh
yarn create vue-termui
```

With pnpm:

```sh
pnpm create vue-termui
```

This command will install and execute `create-vue-termui`, the official Vue TermUI project scaffolding tool and prompt you for the name of the folder is should create. Once it's done, it will let you know how to install the dependencies on the project and start it!
