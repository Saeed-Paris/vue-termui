# Quick Start

Let's get a simple Vue TermUI app running on your machine so you can start building your cool new terminal app ðŸ˜Ž

:::tip Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with the command line
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 (Recommended v14)

:::

You can start a project by using the starter. It is configured to use TypeScript by default:

```sh
npm create vue-termui@latest
```

This command will install and execute `create-vue-termui`, the official Vue TermUI project scaffolding tool.
